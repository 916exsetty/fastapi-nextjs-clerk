## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a modern web application with a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend. Users can authenticate through Clerk, which issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). These tokens allow secure access to protected API endpoints in the FastAPI backend.

## Features

- User authentication using Clerk
- Secure API access with JWTs
- Responsive frontend built with Next.js
- FastAPI backend for handling requests
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Comprehensive documentation

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/916exsetty/fastapi-nextjs-clerk.git
   cd fastapi-nextjs-clerk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   For the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your Clerk API keys:

   ```plaintext
   CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Use Docker Compose to start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`. The login page will allow users to authenticate using Clerk. After logging in, users can access protected resources through the FastAPI backend.

### Authentication Flow

1. The user visits the login page.
2. The user enters their credentials and submits the form.
3. Clerk verifies the credentials and issues a JWT.
4. The frontend sends the JWT to the backend for API access.
5. The backend validates the JWT and responds accordingly.

## API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend provides several endpoints for interaction. Here are some key endpoints:

- **GET /api/protected**

  This endpoint requires a valid JWT for access. It returns protected data.

- **POST /api/login**

  This endpoint allows users to log in. It expects user credentials and returns a JWT.

- **GET /api/users**

  This endpoint retrieves a list of users. It requires a valid JWT.
